Through this short blog post I'll go into details of why I wanted to create a personal blog, why didn't I just use [medium](https://medium.com) and why I chose [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org) as the blog's framework.

## First things first

I wanted to create a blog to talk about the things I do and the ideas I have for over a year now, but I never got to it.

One reason was to structure my ideas or document code I write and reuse often in ways other people might find helpful. Another reason was that I wanted to try out static website generators for React and lastly because I wanted to have a **portfolio** of sorts, a **presence** in the web.

## But Medium

Yeah, [medium](https://medium.com) is nice and I read it a lot, but it has a limit on free articles, which I'm not a huge fan. Also every time I try to write something there I'm not trully engaged, which means I never finish a post. With my own personal website I can do whatever I want and style it the way I want it to be.

It is also challenging to build something new and I don't see the time pass while writing here, since I'm pretty confortable with my code editor interface.
